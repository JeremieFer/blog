# Blog Writing Style

## Self-Updating Rule
- Every time the user asks to edit text, write a paragraph, adjust design, or change formatting, compare the request against this rule file.
- If the request reveals a new preference not already captured here, append it to the relevant section.

## Formatting
- Prefer bullet points with **bold lead-in titles** over plain paragraphs (e.g. `<li><strong>Key point:</strong> explanation</li>`)
- Use `<h2>` sections to break content into scannable chunks
- Bold introductory phrases on standalone paragraphs when they serve as a label (e.g. `<strong>Environment state:</strong> Environments need to...`)
- Keep paragraphs short — 1-3 sentences max

## Tone & Voice
- Casual, conversational, first-person
- Use contractions, parenthetical asides, and rhetorical questions for flavor
- Ok to be playful and direct (e.g. "Only 499 to go.", "... it fails.")
- Not academic — write like you're explaining to a smart friend

## Code Blocks
- Always use syntax highlighting (highlight.js with `atom-one-dark` theme)
- Trim code/data to only the essential properties — never dump full verbose output
- JSON examples should show just enough fields to convey the point
- Python/code should be real and functional, not pseudocode

## Media & Visuals
- Use images/GIFs near analogies to make abstract concepts tangible
- Embed videos natively with `<video>` tag from local assets, not external iframes
- Center standalone images, apply border-radius for polish

## Page Structure
- Start with a clear `<h1>` title
- Build sections as a narrative arc: context → concept → example → proof
- End with a social/follow section and a call to action
